## Pain Points Section

### Section Header
"Running a Roofing Business Is Hard Enough"

### Pain Point 1: The Shoebox Problem
**Icon:** 📦 Receipt/box
**Headline:** Drowning in Receipts
**Copy:** Your truck console is full of Home Depot receipts. Your email is full of supplier invoices. Your accountant is full of questions. Sound familiar?

### Pain Point 2: No Visibility
**Icon:** 🔮 Crystal ball (crossed out)
**Headline:** Flying Blind on Cash
**Copy:** You finished three jobs last month but you're still scrambling for payroll. Where did the money go? Which jobs actually made money? You shouldn't need a fortune teller to know.

### Pain Point 3: Feast or Famine
**Icon:** 🎢 Rollercoaster
**Headline:** The Cash Flow Rollercoaster
**Copy:** Storm season you're flush. Winter you're stressed. One slow month and suddenly you're floating payroll on a credit card. There's got to be a better way.

### Pain Point 4: Your "Bookkeeper"
**Icon:** 📊 Spreadsheet
**Headline:** QuickBooks Isn't Enough
**Copy:** You bought QuickBooks. Maybe you even hired a bookkeeper. But they don't understand roofing—job costing, insurance claims, material runs. You're still doing half the work yourself.
