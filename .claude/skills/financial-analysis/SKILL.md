### Material Cost Analysis

```
MATERIALS TO REVENUE RATIO
==========================

Target Range: 25-35% of revenue

Calculation:
Total Material Costs / Total Revenue × 100 = [X]%

If OVER target:
□ Review supplier pricing
□ Check for material waste
□ Verify accurate takeoffs
□ Look for theft/shrinkage
□ Renegotiate vendor contracts

If UNDER target:
□ May be using substandard materials
□ Could be underestimating jobs
□ Might have opportunity to upgrade
```

### Labor Efficiency Metrics

```
LABOR ANALYSIS
==============

Squares per Man-Day: [X]
Target: 3-5 squares per man-day

Revenue per Field Employee: $[Amount]
Target: $150,000+ annually

Labor Cost per Square:
  Direct labor: $[Amount]
  Taxes/Benefits: $[Amount]
  Total: $[Amount]

Labor as % of Revenue: [X]%
Target: 25-35%
```

## Cash Flow Analysis

### Cash Flow Timing (Typical Roofing)

```
CASH FLOW TIMELINE
==================

DAY 0: Contract Signed
       Deposit Received: [X]% of contract

DAY 1-7: Materials Ordered
         Materials Paid: Often due NET 30

DAY 7-14: Installation
          Labor Paid: Weekly payroll

DAY 14-21: Project Complete
           Final Payment Due

DAY 21-60: Insurance Work
           Insurance payment received

CASH FLOW GAP: [X] days on average
Working Capital Needed: $[Amount]
```

### Cash Flow Improvement Strategies

1. **Increase deposits** - Move from 10% to 33%
2. **Progress payments** - Bill at 50% completion
3. **Faster invoicing** - Invoice same day as completion
4. **Payment terms** - Due on completion, not NET 30
5. **Credit cards** - Accept for faster payment
6. **Supplier terms** - Negotiate NET 45-60
7. **Line of credit** - Bridge seasonal gaps

## Profit Leak Identification

### Common Roofing Profit Leaks

| Leak | Typical Cost | Solution |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Material waste | 5-10% of materials | Better takeoffs, training |
| Unbilled change orders | $200-500/job | Document everything |
| Warranty callbacks | 2-5% of revenue | Quality control |
| Lead leakage | 20-40% of leads | CRM, follow-up process |
| Crew inefficiency | 10-20% of labor | Training, incentives |
| Underbilling | $100-300/job | Accurate estimating |
| Bad debt | 1-3% of revenue | Credit checks, deposits |
