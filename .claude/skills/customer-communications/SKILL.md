...it's worth having someone take a look.

We're offering FREE storm damage inspections this week

answers about whether you have damage that should be
addressed.

## Handling Concerns

### Response to Complaint

```
Subject: RE: [Their Subject Line]

Hi [First Name],

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'm truly
sorry to hear about [brief acknowledgment of issue].

This is not the experience we want any customer to have,
and I take full responsibility for making it right.

Here's what I'm going to do:
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Follow-up action]
3. [Resolution timeline]

I'd also like to speak with you directly. Are you
available for a call today? I'm free at [times].

Your satisfaction is my top priority.

[Your Name]
[Phone - direct line]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly** - Same-day response for all inquiries
2. **Use their name** - Personalization builds connection
3. **Be specific** - Dates, times, amounts, names
4. **Call to action** - Tell them what to do next
5. **Follow up** - Don't let leads go cold
6. **Proofread** - Typos hurt credibility

## Example Prompts

- "Write a follow-up email for an estimate sent 5 days ago"
- "Draft a text message for appointment reminder"
- "Create a storm damage outreach email for hail"
- "Write a response to an unhappy customer"
- "Help me ask for a Google review"
