## Objection Handling Scripts

### "I need to get more quotes"
```
"I completely understand - this is a big decision. Many
of our customers felt the same way. What I've found is
that by the time you get 3-4 quotes, you've spent
several hours of your time.

Can I ask what specifically you're hoping to compare?
If it's price, I'm confident in our value. If it's
something else, let me see if I can address that now."
```

### "Your price is higher than the other guy"
```
"I appreciate you sharing that. We're rarely the
cheapest, and here's why that's actually a good thing
for you...

The difference usually comes down to:
1. Quality of materials - we never cut corners
2. Our crews - trained employees, not pickup crews
3. Our warranty - 10 years vs the typical 2
4. Our service - you can actually reach us after the job

What would it cost you if you had a problem and the
other company was out of business or didn't return calls?"
```

### "I need to talk to my spouse"
```
"Of course - this is a decision you should make together.
Is there anything specific you think they'll want to
know that I can help you with now?

Actually, would it be helpful if I called your spouse
directly to answer any questions? Or we could schedule
a time when you're both available?"
```

### "This isn't a good time"
```
"I understand timing is everything. May I ask what's
making this not the right time - is it the budget,
your schedule, or something else?

[If budget]: That's why we offer financing - we can
get your roof protected now with payments as low as
$[X]/month.

[If schedule]: We work around your schedule completely.
You don't need to be home during installation."
```

### "Let me think about it"
```
"Absolutely, take the time you need. This is an
important decision.

To help you think it through, what would you say is
the biggest thing on your mind right now about
moving forward?

[Address their specific concern]

Also, I should mention our schedule is booking out
[X] weeks right now. If you'd like, I can pencil
you in tentatively and you can confirm by [date]?"
```

## Value Proposition Framework

### The "Why Now" Pitch
```
I know it's tempting to wait on a roof replacement,
but here's what I see homeowners often overlook:

1. DAMAGE COMPOUNDS - That small leak today becomes
   a $5,000 mold remediation next year.

2. ENERGY COSTS - Your aging roof is costing you
   [X]% more in heating/cooling every month.

3. PRICES ONLY GO UP - Material costs have increased
   [X]% in the past year. Next year won't be cheaper.

4. YOUR TIME - The longer you wait, the more
   restricted your scheduling options become.

The best time to fix your roof is before you
absolutely have to.
```

## Example Prompts

- "Create a Good/Better/Best proposal for this customer"
- "Write financing options for a $15,000 roof"
- "How should I handle 'I need more quotes'?"
- "Create a proposal comparison chart vs competitors"
- "Write a value proposition for premium shingles"
