# SOP: Follow-Up Cadence

```
Document #: SALES-004
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: [DATE]

```

## Purpose

Maximize conversion of estimates through systematic, persistent follow-up while maintaining professionalism and respect for customer preferences.

## Scope

All estimates provided to residential and commercial customers that did not close on the initial visit.

## Core Principle

**"The fortune is in the follow-up."**

Research shows:
- 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups
- 44% of salespeople give up after 1 follow-up
- Persistent (not pushy) follow-up wins business

## Follow-Up Cadence: Standard Estimates

### Day 1 (Same Day as Appointment)

**Action 1: Thank You Text (within 30 minutes)**
```
Hi [First Name], thanks again for your time today!
I'm sending over your estimate now. Let me know if
any questions come up. - [Your Name], [Company]
```

**Action 2: Email Estimate (within 1 hour)**
Full estimate with cover letter (see SALES-003)

---

### Day 2 (Next Day)

**Action: Follow-Up Call**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].
I'm just calling to make sure you received the
estimate I sent yesterday and to see if you had
any questions after looking it over."

If they haven't reviewed it:
"No problem! When would be a good time to call
back after you've had a chance to review it?"

If they have questions:
[Answer questions thoroughly]
[Ask for the sale if appropriate]
```

If no answer → Leave voicemail + send text:
```
VM: "Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company]. Just
following up on the estimate I sent. Give me a
call when you have a chance - [phone].
Looking forward to hearing from you!"

Text: "Hey [Name], just tried calling to follow up
on your estimate. Any questions? Happy to chat
whenever works for you. - [Your Name]"
```

### Day 4

**Action: Email Check-In**
```
Subject: Quick question about your roof project

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to check in on the estimate we put together
for [Address]. I know choosing a roofer is a big
decision, and I'm here to help with any questions.

A few things that might be helpful:
• Our schedule is currently booking out [X] weeks
• We have [financing option] available if helpful
• Happy to walk through the options again if needed

Is there anything holding you back that I can help address?

### Day 7 (One Week)

**Action: Phone Call**
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company]. It's been
about a week since we met, and I wanted to touch
base. Have you had a chance to think about your
roof project?"

Listen for:
- Still deciding → Address concerns
- Going with competitor → Ask why (learn)
- Not right now → Offer to follow up later
- Ready to move forward → Schedule and close
```

---

### Day 10

**Action: Value-Add Email**
```
Subject: [Something relevant to their situation]

Hi [First Name],

I was thinking about your roof and wanted to share
[relevant information]:

[Choose appropriate content:]
- Article about roofing materials we discussed
- Before/after photos of similar project
- Customer testimonial from their area
- Information about warranty coverage
- Tip related to their specific situation

No pressure - just thought this might be helpful
as you're making your decision.

### Day 14 (Two Weeks)

**Action: Phone Call + Text**
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company]. Just wanted
to circle back one more time. Have you made a
decision on your roof project?"

If still undecided:
"I totally understand. Can I ask - is it the timing,
the budget, or something else? I want to make sure
I'm being helpful, not pushy."
```

---

### Day 21 (Three Weeks)

**Action: Final Email**
```
Subject: Closing out your estimate file

Hi [First Name],

I'm doing some file housekeeping and noticed we
haven't connected since I sent your estimate.

I want to be respectful of your time, so this will
be my last outreach for now. If you've decided to
go another direction, I understand - no hard feelings!

If you're still considering us, please know:
• Your estimate is valid for 30 days from [date]
• I'm happy to update it if prices have changed
• We can revisit options if your needs have changed

Whenever you're ready, I'm here to help.

All the best,
[Signature]
```

### Day 30+

**Action: Move to Long-Term Nurture**
- Add to email newsletter
- Quarterly check-in call
- Annual "roof check" reminder

## Follow-Up Cadence: Hot Leads (High Intent)

For leads showing strong buying signals, compress timeline:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Estimate + Thank you |
| 1 | Call (AM) + Call (PM if no answer) |
| 2 | Call + Text |
| 3 | Email |
| 4 | Call |
| 5 | Call + Email |
| 7 | Standard cadence continues |

## Follow-Up Cadence: Storm/Insurance Leads

Higher frequency due to time-sensitive nature:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Estimate + Thank you |
| 1 | Call |
| 2 | Call + Text |
| 3 | Call |
| 4 | Email (mention deadlines) |
| 5 | Call |
| 7 | Call + Email |
| 10 | Call |
| 14 | Standard cadence |

## Response to Common Situations

### "I'm getting other quotes"
```
"That's smart - you should compare. I'm curious,
what are you hoping to learn from the other quotes?
Is there something I didn't cover that would be helpful?"

Then:
"Would it be okay if I checked back with you [specific
date] after you've had a chance to compare?"
```

### "I'm not ready yet"
```
"I understand timing is everything. Is it okay if
I ask - is there a specific reason for the timing,
or are you just not in a hurry?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I checked back with you in
[timeframe they mention]? I can put a note in my
calendar so I don't forget."
```

### "We decided to go with someone else"
```
"I appreciate you letting me know. Would you mind
sharing what tipped the scales? I'm always looking
to improve, and your feedback would really help."

[Listen and thank them]

"If anything changes or you need help in the future,
please keep us in mind. Best of luck with your project!"
```

### "We're not going to do it right now"
```
"Totally understand. Things change, priorities shift.
Is it okay if I reach out again in a few months?
We could do an updated inspection to make sure
nothing has gotten worse."
```
