## Purpose

Protect employees from falls, the leading cause of death in construction. Ensure compliance with OSHA regulations and prevent injuries.

## Scope

All roofing work where employees are exposed to fall hazards of 6 feet or greater.

## OSHA Requirements

- 29 CFR 1926.501(b)(13) - Residential construction fall protection
- 29 CFR 1926.502 - Fall protection criteria and practices
- 29 CFR 1926.503 - Training requirements

## Fall Protection Trigger Height

| Construction Type | Trigger Height |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Residential roofing | 6 feet |
| Commercial roofing | 6 feet |
| General construction | 6 feet |

**Note:** Some states have stricter requirements (e.g., California = 7.5 feet for residential). Check local regulations.

## Fall Protection Methods

### Option 1: Guardrail Systems

**When to Use:**
- Flat or low-slope roofs
- Extended work on roof perimeter
- When other methods impractical

**Requirements:**
- Top rail: 42" (+/- 3") above walking surface
- Mid-rail: Halfway between top rail and walking surface
- Withstand 200 lb force in any direction
- Smooth surface (no splinters, puncture hazards)

### Option 2: Safety Net Systems

**When to Use:**
- Large commercial projects
- Extended duration work

**Requirements:**
- Installed as close as practical below work area
- Maximum 30 feet below
- Extend 8 feet beyond work edge
- Capable of absorbing energy of fall

### Option 3: Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS)

**When to Use:**
- Most common for residential roofing
- Steep slope roofs
- Areas where guardrails impractical

**Components Required:**
1. **Anchorage** - Must support 5,000 lbs per person
2. **Body harness** - Full body, ANSI-approved
3. **Connecting device** - Lanyard or SRL

### Option 4: Alternative Measures (Residential Only)

Per OSHA Directive STD 03-00-001, alternative methods permitted when conventional methods create greater hazard:
- Slide guards
- Safety monitors
- Warning lines

**Requires written plan on file**

## Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS) Procedures

### 1. Equipment Requirements

**Anchorage:**
- Roof anchor rated for 5,000 lbs per person
- Installed per manufacturer instructions
- Positioned to minimize swing fall
- Inspected before each use

**Full Body Harness:**
- ANSI Z359.11 compliant
- Properly fitted to worker
- Inspected before each use
- D-ring between shoulder blades

**Lanyard/Connecting Device:**
- Shock-absorbing lanyard, OR
- Self-retracting lifeline (SRL)
- Max free fall of 6 feet
- Total fall distance consideration

### 2. Pre-Use Equipment Inspection

**Harness Inspection:**
- [ ] Webbing - no cuts, burns, fraying, chemicals
- [ ] Stitching - intact, no broken threads
- [ ] D-rings - no cracks, corrosion, sharp edges
- [ ] Buckles - function properly, no damage
- [ ] Labels - legible, within service life

**Lanyard Inspection:**
- [ ] Webbing/rope - no damage, fraying, cuts
- [ ] Snap hooks - gate functions, locks properly
- [ ] Shock absorber - not deployed, no damage
- [ ] Labels - legible, within service life

**Anchor Inspection:**
- [ ] Secure attachment to structure
- [ ] No visible damage or corrosion
- [ ] Properly positioned
- [ ] Weight rated and labeled

### 3. Proper Fitting

**Harness Fitting Steps:**
1. Hold harness by D-ring, shake to untangle
2. Step into leg straps, pull up
3. Pull shoulder straps over shoulders
4. Connect chest strap
5. Buckle all buckles
6. Adjust leg straps - snug, not tight
7. Adjust chest strap - center of chest
8. D-ring should be between shoulder blades
9. All straps flat, no twists

**Fit Check:**
- Two fingers should fit under straps
- No loose ends dangling
- No crossed straps
- Movement not restricted

### 4. Anchorage Installation

**Temporary Roof Anchors:**
1. Select location - over rafter or truss
2. Position to minimize swing fall
3. Install per manufacturer instructions
4. Verify secure attachment
5. Test by applying body weight

**Anchor Positioning:**
- Keep anchor above worker when possible
- Consider swing fall potential
- Calculate total fall distance
- Never share anchor (unless rated)

### 5. Fall Distance Calculation

**Calculate BEFORE working:**
```
Total Fall Distance =
  Free Fall (max 6 ft)
+ Deceleration Distance (3.5 ft)
+ Harness Stretch (1 ft)
+ D-Ring Slide (1 ft)
+ Worker Height (6 ft)
+ Safety Factor (3 ft)
= Minimum 20.5 ft clearance needed
```

**Important:** If clearance is less than calculated distance, use shorter lanyard or SRL.

### 6. Working in PFAS

**Work Practices:**
- Stay connected 100% of the time
- Never disconnect to move locations
- Keep slack out of lanyard
- Don't work beyond anchor reach
- Be aware of swing fall hazard

**Moving on Roof:**
- Use horizontal lifeline if available
- Relocate anchor as needed
- Never work unprotected

### 7. Rescue Plan

**OSHA Requires Prompt Rescue**

**Rescue Options:**
1. Self-rescue if able
2. Co-worker assisted rescue
3. Aerial lift rescue
4. Fire department (call 911)

**Rescue Equipment on Site:**
- Extension ladder
- Rescue kit (if available)
- Knife to cut lanyard
- First aid kit
- Phone for 911

**Suspension Trauma Warning:**
A worker suspended in harness can develop life-threatening suspension trauma within 10-15 minutes.
**RESCUE MUST BE PROMPT**

### 8. Inspection and Removal

**After Use:**
- Inspect equipment for damage
- Clean if dirty
- Store properly (hanging, dry location)
- Document inspection

**Remove from Service If:**
- Involved in fall arrest
- Any visible damage
- Exceeds manufacturer service life
- Labels illegible
- Failed inspection

**Equipment Involved in Fall:**
- Remove from service immediately
- Do not reuse
- Destroy to prevent reuse
- Document and investigate fall
