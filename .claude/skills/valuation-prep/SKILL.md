# Valuation Preparation & Exit Planning

Help roofing business owners maximize enterprise value through strategic improvements to key value drivers.

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing a roofing business for sale
- Understanding valuation multiples
- Improving key value drivers
- Creating an exit timeline
- Reducing owner dependency
- Building recurring revenue streams

## Roofing Business Valuation Fundamentals

### Valuation Methods

**1. EBITDA Multiple (Most Common)**
```
Enterprise Value = Adjusted EBITDA × Multiple

Typical Multiples for Roofing Companies:
- Small (<$1M revenue): 2.0-3.0x
- Medium ($1-5M revenue): 2.5-3.5x
- Large ($5-10M revenue): 3.0-4.5x
- Enterprise ($10M+ revenue): 4.0-6.0x
```

**2. Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE)**
```
For smaller businesses:
Value = SDE × Multiple (typically 2.0-3.5x)

SDE = Net Income + Owner Salary + Owner Benefits +
      Depreciation + Interest + One-time Expenses
```

**3. Revenue Multiple**
```
Less common, but used for high-growth:
Value = Revenue × Multiple (typically 0.3-0.8x)
```

### EBITDA Adjustments (Add-Backs)

| Category | Common Add-Backs |
|----------|------------------|
| Owner Compensation | Excess owner salary above market rate |
| Personal Expenses | Owner vehicle, travel, meals charged to business |
| One-Time Costs | Legal settlement, equipment purchase, unusual repairs |
| Non-Recurring | Startup costs, consulting fees, severance |
| Family Wages | Family members not providing market-rate value |
| Rent | Below or above-market rent to related party |
| Depreciation | Non-cash expense added back |
| Interest | Financing costs added back |

### Typical Adjusted EBITDA Calculation

```
ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION
===========================

Net Income (from P&L):                $[Amount]

ADD BACK:
+ Owner Salary (above market):        $[Amount]
+ Owner Benefits:                     $[Amount]
+ Owner Vehicle/Personal:             $[Amount]
+ Depreciation:                       $[Amount]
+ Interest Expense:                   $[Amount]
+ One-Time Expenses:                  $[Amount]
+ Non-Recurring Items:                $[Amount]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
= ADJUSTED EBITDA:                    $[Amount]

× MULTIPLE:                           [X]x
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
= ENTERPRISE VALUE:                   $[Amount]
```
