# Valuation Magnet Module — Overview (v2)

## Purpose
The Valuation Magnet is a **product-led sales entry point** for Spec-OS and CrewCFO that delivers a fast, credible, industry-specific valuation for roofing contractors and converts insight into action by mapping improvements directly to Spec-OS **CFO / CMO / CTO** modules.

It operates as a **standalone valuation intelligence product** and as the front door into the broader Spec-OS operating system.

This is **not an appraisal**. It is a directional, operationally grounded valuation intelligence engine aligned with how buyers actually underwrite roofing businesses.

## Scope (Explicit)
Included:
- TTM **SDE and EBITDA** valuation ranges
- **Matador tier–based multiple selection**
- Value driver scoring + tier movement logic
- No-Excel scenario simulation (“what moves value”)
- Exit readiness + deal room preparation
- Roadmap generation mapped to Spec-OS modules

Excluded:
- Auto-posting accounting entries
- Formal appraisal opinions
- Broker pricing or market making

## ICP
U.S. roofing companies:
- $2M–$50M revenue
- Owner-operator or lightly managed
- QBO as system of record
- 1–5 year growth or exit horizon

## Core Promise (15-minute outcome)
“Connect your data → See what your business is worth → See exactly what to fix to increase value.”

## Relationship to Books OS
- Read-only, non-posting
- Books OS remains the financial system of record
- Valuation confidence increases as Books OS, CMO OS, and CTO OS modules activate
